## [Lecture_00 Slides](Week00_files/Lecture00_Overview_BigData.pdf)

We will begin the lecture with the ppt presentation.  At the conclusion of the presentation, we will complete the following exercises prior to the end of the class period to get your computers set up for next week.  You should not leave the class until you have completed these exercises because if you have trouble, I can help you now and we will not spend time on this next week.

## IN CLASS EXERCISES

Do not begin these until we complete the lecture. You need to complete them in order.

### Log into GitHub
Create an Account if You Do Not Have One

### [In Lecture Quiz 0.0](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=8frLNKZngUepylFOslULZlFZdbyVx8RLiPt1GobhHnlUMlExSEtYN0pTTFVXUzJJUlpYRUNGQzU1Ti4u)
During most lectures we will take a few minutes at least once and ask you to apply the concepts addressed in lecture. You will be expected to have the class's GitHub repository open in a web browser to follow the links to the questions.  You must be logged into [TAMUCC's webmail](https://outlook.tamucc.edu)


### If you have a Win10/11 computer, [set up the Windows Linux Subsystem and install the Ubuntu App *_**Now With Automation**_*](https://github.com/cbirdlab/wlsUBUNTU_settings)
For those of you with windows, we will install an Ubuntu terminal that interfaces with the Linux kernel build into Win10.  Software installed in windows is not accessible in Ubuntu and vice versa.  You will be able to navigate the same files and directories with both. 

This should have already been done on the computers in the lab.

### [Install git on your computer](https://computingskillsforbiologists.com/setup/)
For Win10 laptops, follow the instructions for both Windows and Linux (Ubuntu Terminal)

This should have already been done on the computers in the lab.

### [Clone the text book's repository to your computer](https://computingskillsforbiologists.com/setup/)
Complete steps 2 and 3. For Win10 laptops, use Ubuntu Terminal

The repository is named CSB, and it contains all of the example files and directories necessary to conduct the exercises in the text book.

### Install a text editor on your computer
Win10: [notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)

MacOSX: [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html)

This should have already been done on the computers in the lab.

These text editors are very handy for viewing and editing code
