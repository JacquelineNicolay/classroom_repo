## [Lecture_00 Stream](https://tamucc.webex.com/webappng/sites/tamucc/recording/playback/c435d912674b47eda6ca33daa6491eab)

## [Lecture_00 Slides](Week00_files/Lecture00_Overview_BigData.pdf)

We will begin the lecture with the ppt presentation.  At the conclusion of the presentation, we will complete the following exercises prior to the end of the class period to get your computers set up for next week.  You should not leave the class until you have completed these exercises because if you have trouble, I can help you now and we will not spend time on this next week.

## IN CLASS EXERCISES

Do not begin these until we complete the lecture. You need to complete them in order.

### Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/)
Create an Account if You Do Not Have One. Git is a version control software and github is a cloudstorage server that serves as the hub of collaborative projects and it is where the master copy of your data and data analysis scripts lie. Github makes following core data science philosophy easy. The philosophy is, after data is digitized, all manipulations of the data should be documented and executed in code. This facilitates transparency, reproduction of methods, and we are progressing toward a day when you’re scientific research papers will be rejected if you don’t provide the scripts used to process your data. https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-and-github-for-beginners/ .

### [In Lecture Quiz 0.0](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=8frLNKZngUepylFOslULZlFZdbyVx8RLiPt1GobhHnlUMlExSEtYN0pTTFVXUzJJUlpYRUNGQzU1Ti4u)
During most lectures we will take a few minutes at least once and ask you to apply the concepts addressed in lecture. You will be expected to have the class's GitHub repository open in a web browser to follow the links to the questions.  You must be logged into [TAMUCC's webmail](https://outlook.tamucc.edu)


### If you have a Win10/11 computer, [set up the Windows Linux Subsystem and install the Ubuntu App *_**Now With Automation**_*](https://github.com/cbirdlab/wlsUBUNTU_settings)
For those of you with windows, we will install an Ubuntu terminal that interfaces with the Linux kernel build into Win10.  Software installed in windows is not accessible in Ubuntu and vice versa.  You will be able to navigate the same files and directories with both. 

### [Install git on your computer](https://computingskillsforbiologists.com/setup/)
For Win10 laptops, follow the instructions for both Windows and Linux (Ubuntu Terminal)

 <!-- 
### [Clone the text book's repository to your computer](https://computingskillsforbiologists.com/setup/)
Complete steps 2 and 3. For Win10 laptops, use Ubuntu Terminal

The repository is named CSB, and it contains all of the example files and directories necessary to conduct the exercises in the text book.

### [Set Up SSH Permissions Key](../resources/Github_SSH.pdf) And Say Goodbye to Passwords

### Install a text editor on your computer
Win10: [notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)

MacOSX: [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html)

These text editors are very handy for viewing and editing code. Text editors edit human readable text files, such as ASCII (.txt). Most likely, the text editor you've been using is insufficient for this course. MS Word is not a text editor; it is a word processor and should not be used.
